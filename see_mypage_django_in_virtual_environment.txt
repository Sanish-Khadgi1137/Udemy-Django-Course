we got error while installing django "Globally"
saying "  WARNING: Failed to write executable - trying to use .deleteme logic
ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified: 'C:\\Python311\\Scripts\\django-admin.exe' -> 'C:\\Python311\\Scripts\\django-admin.exe.deleteme'
"

so we installed django in virtual environment

so we have to activate that venv and create program etc

so we have to activate that venv to run the program to(staying in that folder which have created "project")
here we 
1. activated fordjangotutorial_venv
2. stay in folder "mypage" which has sub-folder "mypage" as well "manage.py"


in django App ~= Module

1. created "mypage" django project (with "mypage" subfolder and manage.py in sider it)
2. from "mypage" folder we created app "challenges"

.

cannot run old project with new venv_ django installed

we need to sign in to pc/brower to clone private repository

virtual environment with 3.11 version of python cannot run on pc with python version 3.12

we are able to run this code without activating virtual environment in this pc hp as it has django installed globally
